Using a database named 'Animal_Shelter' to finish a following tasks.
The database contains 9 tables each have some columns regarding a dog/cat's information.




1. Joins

The task:
    Write a query to report animals and their vaccinations.
    Inlcude the animals that have not been vaccinated.
    The report should show the animal's:
    name, species, breed and primary color,vaccine name, the staff member's first name, last name and role.

2. Filtering and Grouping with DISTINCT

Write a query to report the number of vaccinations each animal has received.
Include animals that were never vaccinated. 

Exclude rabbits, rabies vaccines, and animals that were last vaccinated on or after 01/10/2019.
The report should show:
    the animals name,
    species,
    primary color,
    breed, and
    the number of vaccinations. 
Use the correct logical join types and force order if needed. 
Use the correct logical group by expressions.

    ,MAX(A.Breed) AS Breed 
    -- Created Dummy Aggregate to avoid Group By error, the other way is to Group each of them

FROM Animals AS A 
    LEFT OUTER JOIN -- All animals both Vaccinated and NonVaccinated
    Vaccinations AS V
    ON A.Name = V.Name AND A.Species = V.Species
GROUP BY A.Species, A.Name
ORDER BY A.Species, A.Name

--- COUNT(*) will reply counts even when not vaccinated.
--- So remove COUNT(*) and continue:

SELECT 
    A.Name
    ,A.Species
    ,MAX(A.Primary_Color) AS Primary_Color -- Created Dummy Aggregate
    ,MAX(A.Breed) AS Breed -- Created Dummy Aggregate
    ,COUNT(V.Vaccine) AS VaxCount

    --- Dealt with NULL, include them in return using 'OR...IS NULL'
GROUP BY A.Species, A.Name
ORDER BY A.Species, A.Name


--- Then continue to deal with date range:

SELECT 
    A.Name
    ,A.Species
    ,MAX(A.Primary_Color) AS Primary_Color -- Created Dummy Aggregate
    ,MAX(A.Breed) AS Breed -- Created Dummy Aggregate

    --- To add 'AND V.Vaccination_Time < '20191001' is not ok
    --- Because the task is to illminate the grouped animal, not the individual rows
GROUP BY A.Species, A.Name

HAVING

    --- Define inside GROUP max time range
    --- Again, deal with NULL, return them instead of allowing ignorance
